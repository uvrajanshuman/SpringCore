# Autowiring by Annotation:-
	
	@Component --> bean (specifies spring that it needs to manage the instance of these classes).
	
	@Autowired --> dependency (specifies dependencies; Spring would look for this dependency
					among the bean it manages and would inject it).
	
# @Autowired can be used on property, setter methods and the constructor.
	when used on property or setter method --> setter injection.
	when used on constructor --> constructor injection.
				   
# If the dependency can be resolved by more than one class/bean then putting @Component on more
  than one classes (dependencies) causes ambiguity and thus is not allowed.
  
# Ex: Let BinarySearch class dependency SortAlgorithm can be resolved by let two classes
	BubbleSort and HeapSort
 If any one of these class is annotated with @Component the autowiring happens without any hassle.
 So, if two or more bean exist for a single dependency it causes error.
