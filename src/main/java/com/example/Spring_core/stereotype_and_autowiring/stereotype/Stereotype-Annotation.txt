# Stereotype Annotations:-
	Till now we were declaring beans in xml configuration file as:
	 <beans ...........
	 ...............>
	 	<bean><bean>
	 </beans> 
	 
	 The equivalent of this can also be done using annotations.
	 
# XML: <bean>     Annotation: @Component

# @Component annotation is used to define a bean.
  Spring IOC container will manage these beans.
  
# But, for allowing Spring Framework to scan specific packages to get @Component
  annotated classes and manage them; the component scan needs to be specified.
  
# The packages and sub-packages specified in component scan will be scanned to get beans.

# Component scan can also be specified in two ways:
  a) using Annotation 
  b) using xml config file
  
# Note:-
	The default name of @Component annotated class is the class name in camel case
	Ex:-
		Student (class) --> student (bean)
	
	To change the default bean name:
	@Component("ob")
	public class Student{
		..........
	}
	//driver class
	context.getBean("ob", Student.class);
