# Case of Ambiguity:- 
	Multiple constructors with same no. but different type of arguments,
	may lead to ambiguity of which constructor to be used for dependency injection.
	
# <constructor-arg value="20"/>
# The default data type of 'type' attribute in constructor-arg is String.

# <constructor-arg value="20" type="int"/>
# In case of ambiguity (muliple constructor with same no. but different types of arguments present)
  the type needs to be defined explicitly if it is not String.
# By default values are treated to be String.


# <constructor-arg value="20" type="int" index="1"/>
# The 'index' attribute can also be used to specify index of passed constructor arg.
