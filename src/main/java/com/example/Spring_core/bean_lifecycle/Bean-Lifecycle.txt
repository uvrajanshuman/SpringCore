# Lifecycle of a Bean:-
	Spring provides two important lifecycle methods to every bean
	
	a) public void init() -->for initialization code
	
	b) public void destroy() -->for cleanup code
	
	The name of these methods can be changed but the signature must remain same.
	
## Lifecycle of a Bean/object:-
	bean created --> bean initialized --> init() --> Ready for use --> destroy() --> bean destroyed
	
# The Spring IOC Container creates instances of a bean and makes sure it is destroyed when not needed.

# In between it provides two methods to do something as soon as bean is created; as well as to 
  do something just before the bean is destroyed.
  
# The lifecycle methods of spring can be configured in 3 ways:
	a) XML configuration
	b) Interface
	c) Annotation
	
# for destroy() method to work the shutdown hook needs to be registered as:
		// Registering shutdown hook
		context.registerShutdownHook();
