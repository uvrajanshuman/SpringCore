# Spring Standalone Collections:-
	-when a collection is defined inside a bean declaration, it's scope is restricted to the bean
	 of it's declaration.
	 
	-But, by using standalone collections same collection can be reused for injecting in multiple beans.
	 It's scope is not limited to a single bean.
	
	-To make standalone collection util schema must be added to XML configuration.
